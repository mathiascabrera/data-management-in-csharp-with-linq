----------    Welcome to the course    ----------

We will analyze each of the operators and clauses that LINQ has for manipulating collections.

LINQ is one of the most important libraries in .NET.

LINQ makes it easy to manipulate data in different collections by minimizing the amount of code to perform a data transformation, filter the data in a collection, or compare the information contained in two collections.

With LINQ we can develop better code and follow the best practices that exist in .NET.

LINQ is essential for making Queries and developing Back End with Entity Framework.

Entity Framework allows us through classes to connect to a Database and manipulate Collections.

With LINQ we can easily perform queries and transformations on the data that will ultimately affect the database.

LINQ is also compatible with other programming languages.
