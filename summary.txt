----------    Welcome to the course    ----------

We will analyze each of the operators and clauses that LINQ has for manipulating collections.

LINQ is one of the most important libraries in .NET.

LINQ makes it easy to manipulate data in different collections by minimizing the amount of code to perform a data transformation, filter the data in a collection, or compare the information contained in two collections.

With LINQ we can develop better code and follow the best practices that exist in .NET.

LINQ is essential for making Queries and developing Back End with Entity Framework.

Entity Framework allows us through classes to connect to a Database and manipulate Collections.

With LINQ we can easily perform queries and transformations on the data that will ultimately affect the database.

LINQ is also compatible with other programming languages.









----------    Pre requirements    ----------

- Knowledge in c#
- Knowledge in .NET
- .NET SDK 6 or higher.
- Visual Studio Code









----------    What´s LINQ?    ----------

Surge en el 2007.

Language-Integrated Query (LINQ). It is a language that is integrated into C# and that allows us to make queries about collections.

LINQ has two ways to be implemented: "Query Expression" and "Extension Methods".

The "Extension Method" is the standard of LINQ usage until now. They are methods that appear within a collection and that allow us to perform filters and different transformations.

"Query Expression" allows us to write queries very similar to SQL queries but using C# syntax.

The namespace to use is "System.Linq". This namespace comes by default in the latest versions of .NET, for example 5 and 6.


.NET Framework is the legacy version of .NET.




 What´s not LINQ?
 
- It is not a programming language. It is only based on a programming language and extends the syntax of C#.

- Not a SQL component.

- It is not a database component. It just brings in a collection from a database and reads or transforms it. We don't need to connect to a database to use LINQ, we simply need a collection of data.

- It is not a third-party bookstore. LINQ, as it belongs to .NET, is also OpenSource.

LINQ is built into .NET. Therefore, LINQ supports all .NET-compatible languages, such as C#, Visual Basic, F#, Visual C++, etc.


LINQ example:

First way (Query Expression):
var unTomate = from t in ArraydeStrings
				where t == "Tomate"
					select t;

Second way (Extension Method):					
var unTomate = ArraydeStrings.Where(t=> t == "Tomate");
